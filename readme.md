# Adversarial Attack
In this assignment, the momentum iterative fast gradient sign method is taken to generate adversarial examples on cifar-10 evaluation set.

Usage:
```
python3 MI_FGSM_ensemble.py [path to cifar-10 evaluation set]
```

The generated images will be stored in the newly created directory 'adv_imgs' in esrc.
